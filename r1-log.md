## Log

### R1D1 
Started learning CSS animation. Worked on some animated content, struggled with CSS transforms.

### R1D2
Started learning github fundamentals. I struggled with folder arrangement, but I resolved it before the end of the day. In the end I was able to push my code to the github repository.

### R1D3
Started learning github commands which go beyond the local repository to the online(remote) repository. I struggled a little learning how to merge my branches to the local repository.

### R1D4
Started learning more CSS aniamtion and transition properties. I struggled a little with implementing transitions, but I was able to resolve it in the end.

### R1D5
Started learning CSS Grid and Flexbox. At first, I experienced some difficulties trying to understand some of the concepts of CSS Grids but, I was able to grasp, to some extent, many of the concepts, at the end of the day. Hope to see some improvements soon.
