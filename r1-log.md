## Log

### R1D1 
Started learning CSS animation. Worked on some animated content, struggled with CSS transforms.

### R1D2
Started learning github fundamentals. I struggled with folder arrangement, but I resolved it before the end of the day. In the end I was able to push my code to the github repository.

### R1D3
Started learning github commands which go beyond the local repository to the online(remote) repository. I struggled a little learning how to merge my branches to the local repository.
