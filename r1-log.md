## Log

### R1D1 
Started learning CSS animation. Worked on some animated content, struggled with CSS transforms.

Started learning github fundamentals. I struggled with folder arrangement, but I resolved it before the end of the day. In the end I was able to push my code to the github repository.

### R1D3
Started learning github commands which go beyond the local repository to the online(remote) repository. I struggled a little learning how to merge my branches to the local repository.

### R1D4
Started learning more CSS aniamtion and transition properties. I struggled a little with implementing transitions, but I was able to resolve it in the end.

### R1D5

### R1D6
Continued learning CSS Grid and Flexbox. I didn't experience most of the challenges which I experienced yesterday.
