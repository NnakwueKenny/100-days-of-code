# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1st, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt the basics of CSS animation.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: May 2nd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to clone repository. Also learnt some basic git commands like: 'add .', 'commit', push.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with GitHub, but, overall, considering the fact that I have a prior knowledge of some of the fundamentals, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Some features are still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. I want to learn how to create a branch and push to the branch and also how to create pull requests and how to merge branches tomorrow.

### Day 3: May 3rd, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt some new git commands like: 'pull', 'merge', checkout, branch. I was able to create a new branch

**Thoughts:** I really feel like the best way I understand how to clone my online repository to my local repository is by using the HTTPS code instead of the SSH key.

### Day 4: May 4th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Concluded my learning of CSS animation, transition and transfromation. I was able to create three distinct boxes, all containing different transition, animation transformation rules.

**Thoughts:** I really felt happy seeing that I was able to implement some animations using @keyframes, animations, transitions and transformations.

### Day 5: May 5th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt CSS grid and Flexbox. I was able to create, using flexbox and grid, the basic layout of a website's homepage.

**Thoughts:** I really felt more comfortable using flexbox (though, not without considering the fact I have been working with it for some time) than I did with Grid. I belive that, working on more projects using Grid, I will improve.

### Day 6: May 6th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt and implemented more CSS grid and Flexbox rules. I was able to create, using flexbox and grid, the basic layout of a website's homepage with added features like scrollable sidebar, using Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I really saw a lot of improvements in my usage of CSS Grid. I will continue to improve.

### Day 7: May 7th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt and implemented more CSS grid and Flexbox rules. I was able to create, using flexbox and grid, the a more advanced layout of a website's homepage (different from the previous day) with added features like scrollable sidebar, using Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Although, i still find CSS Grid a bit hard, I hope to continue to use to bulild cool projects in the future. I will continue to improve.

### Day 8: May 8th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added a new feature to the page: a top navigation panel with a 'toggler' (that hides at a particular screen size and resurfaces at another specified screen size) to toggle the navigation links between show and hide.

**Thoughts:** I really felt happy doing this as I look forward to building cool stuff from now on. I will from henceforth, focus on lerning more advanced javascript features, as I continue to use CSS Grid and flexbox to build better interfaces.

### Day 9: May 9th, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project: a simple calculator - though, it has a nice UI, but- with minimal operations. I was able to build the interface without adding the javascript functionalities.

**Thoughts:** I really felt happy coming up such a cool UI (at least, in my judgement). Though it took me almost the whole day trying to do this, I still hope to improve.
